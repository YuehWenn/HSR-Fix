This tool is designed to compatible to as many single player games as it can, 
we will recompile and upgrade 3dmigoto later,
to allowing us to no longer worry about skin limitations in any PC video games, 
every one should have the rights to modify their game's character by their mind 
instead of get limited by game publisher.

Don't abuse it! only use it in single player game,remember you take your own risk.

# Acknowledgements
Thanks a lot to bob3b, DarkStarSword, for tutorial and code reference.

# Great Shader Fix Projects
GIMI : https://github.com/SilentNightSound/GI-Model-Importer

SRMI : https://github.com/SilentNightSound/SR-Model-Importer

I recommend using GIMI or SRMI's d3d11.dll to enable more fix feature in GI or HSR
instead of original 3dmigoto's d3d11.dll .

It is also useful on other video games too,thanks to SilentNightSound again.
